 * Good practises for C header files.
 * 1. ALWAYS #include guards!
 * 2. #include only necessary libraries!
 * 3. DO NOT define global variables!
 *    Are you sure you need them? There might be a better way.
 *    If you still need them, make sure to employ the `extern` keyword.
 * 4. #define MACROs and declare functions prototype to be shared between
 *    .c source files.
 *
 * Check https://valecs.gitlab.io/resources/CHeaderFileGuidelines.pdf for some
 * more nice practises.
